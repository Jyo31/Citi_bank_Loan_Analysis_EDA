# Citi_bank_Loan_Analysis_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis Project using Python

I always wanted to work with some finance dataset and finally I downloaded the case study of Citi bank from Kaggle platform, This case study was focused on using the EDA and then performing the data visualization task using various Python Libraries. Solving this case study will give us an idea about how real business problems are solved using data analytics.

After successfully completing this project we can understand the basic components of EDA. We performed major 6 steps and they are as follows;

1)Data Exploration
2)Data cleaning
3)Data Analysis
4)Data visualization
5)Logistic Regression
The dataset for this project is taken from Kaggle and we have used Jupyter notebook terminal to write the python code.
